### HTML, CSS, & JavaScript: The Web Development Fundamentals

This presentations will introduce you to the core technologies of web development and guide you through a hands-on MERN stack project.

#### **Section 1: The Building Blocks of the Web**

  * **HTML (HyperText Markup Language):** The skeleton of a webpage. It provides the structure and content.
      * **Key Concepts:** Tags, elements, attributes, semantic HTML5 tags ($`\text{e.g.,} \text{<header>, <nav>, <main>, <footer>}`$), and the Document Object Model (DOM).
      * **Why it Matters:** A well-structured HTML document is crucial for accessibility and search engine optimization (SEO).
  * **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):** The skin of the webpage. It handles the presentation and styling.
      * **Key Concepts:** Selectors, properties, values, the box model, Flexbox, Grid, and responsive design using media queries.
      * **Why it Matters:** CSS makes a website visually appealing and provides a good user experience.
  * **JavaScript:** The brain of the webpage. It adds interactivity and dynamic behavior.
      * **Key Concepts:** Variables, data types, functions, control flow ($`\text{if/else, loops}`$), events, and asynchronous JavaScript ($`\text{Promises, async/await}`$).
      * **Why it Matters:** JavaScript enables features like form validation, animations, and fetching data from an API.

#### **Section 2: The MERN Stack: A Full-Stack Powerhouse**

The MERN stack is a popular technology stack for building dynamic web applications. It's an acronym for:

  * **MongoDB:** A NoSQL **database** that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents.
  * **Express.js:** A minimal and flexible Node.js **web application framework** that handles routing and middleware.
  * **React.js:** A JavaScript **library** for building interactive user interfaces.
  * **Node.js:** A JavaScript **runtime environment** that allows you to run JavaScript on the server side.

#### **Section 3: MERN Stack Demo Project**

We will build a simple full-stack application.

  * **Frontend (React.js):**
      * Create components for the user interface.
      * Use Axios or Fetch to make API calls to the backend.
      * Manage state using React hooks like `useState` and `useEffect`.
  * **Backend (Node.js & Express.js):**
      * Set up a RESTful API to handle HTTP requests ($`\text{GET, POST, PUT, DELETE}`$).
      * Connect to a MongoDB database using a library like Mongoose.
      * Define routes to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
  * **Database (MongoDB):**
      * Design a schema for your data.
      * Store and retrieve data based on requests from the backend.

# üöÄ The MERN Stack Unleashed: A Full-Stack Demo for Modern Developers

Welcome to the ultimate MERN Stack demo! This project is designed to give you a hands-on experience with the complete MERN ecosystem, from setting up the environment to building a fully functional full-stack application.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Frontend:** Built with React.js for a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **Backend:** A RESTful API powered by Node.js and Express.js.
- **Database:** MongoDB for seamless data storage.
- **Full CRUD:** Demonstrate all four operations: Create, Read, Update, and Delete.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** `React`, `React Router Dom`, `Axios`
- **Backend:** `Node.js`, `Express.js`, `Mongoose`, `CORS`
- **Database:** `MongoDB`
- **Tools:** `npm`, `Git`

## üì¶ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.
- [MongoDB Community Server](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) installed and running.
- A code editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-project-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-project-name.git)
    cd your-project-name
    ```

2.  **Install frontend dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd client
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Install backend dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd ../server
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the backend server:**
    ```bash
    cd server
    npm start
    ```
    The server will run on `http://localhost:5000`.

2.  **Start the frontend:**
    ```bash
    cd ../client
    npm start
    ```
    The React app will open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
